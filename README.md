This is the first project of a series of projects to learning Go Lang.
Use these project as you pleased!

First thing, this repo was create through command line.
To create a new repository using command line:

`curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO_NAME"}'`

Just change `USER` by your github username and `REPO_NAME` by the repo name.
After that type your password and if everything goes right the repo will be created.

After that just clone or init local repo and push commits.

That Said let's go to project itself.
This project was created based on [Francesc Campoy](https://twitter.com/francesc) Youtube [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBjoTxosSys).
Checkout his channel, there is very good stuff about Go.
